### **_Description_**

There's that question that people will sometimes ask at a party, "If you could have dinner with 5 person, living or dead, who would it be?"

A play off of the phrase, "DEUS EX MACHNIA", or "The Ghost in the Machine", Chattus Ex Machina (ChEM), is a chatbot app that aims the bring 5 various personalities or Ghosts to a user. And allow users to interact with these Ghosts.

Leveraging OpenAI's Chat API, Axios, and a MERN stack, ChEM will take user input, send it to OpenAI, where the API will respond to the user with predefined context in memory. Suddenly, having the ability to ask Drake "What is the meaning of life?" isn't reserved for super fans or the ultrawealthy.
