### **_Description_**

Introducing Chattus Ex Machina (ChEM), a chatbot app inspired by the phrase "DEUS EX MACHINA" or "The Ghost in the Machine." ChEM brings various personalities or "Ghosts" to users, enabling interactive conversations with them.

In the Lobby, users have the option to start new conversations with different Ghosts, including those they haven't spoken to before. They can also resume previously saved sessions from where they left off.

Within each session, users can rename their session to remember memorable dialogues. Notable features include real-time feedback that informs the user when the Ghost is responding to their latest input. Additionally, ChEM utilizes a useful React package called Scrollable Feed, which automatically renders a scrolling animation to the latest message in the conversation.
